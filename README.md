# Ccal
new implementation to create a console calculator with advance functionalities , i will be using some dependencies such as QuickTools and it will be a console calculator that will also  have a history added to it as well 

# How
This calculator will take the advantage of the console
and input that can be passed to it as an arguments 
***for example:***
- ccal 2 x 2  = 4 
- ccal a = 50 
- ccal b = 50 
- ccal a + b = 100  
So this will be on the way that it will take the input for the calculations and it will be returning the value or just print it to the console.
